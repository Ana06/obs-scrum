# Burndown charts â€“ BS-Team

We currently create our burndown charts with [trollolo](https://github.com/openSUSE/trollolo).
Installation of trollolo and configuration of [trello](https://trello.com) API credentials is
documented [here](https://github.com/openSUSE/trollolo#installation). Use trollolo >= 0.0.14, otherwise you won't be able to use some of the documented commands.

## Starting a new Sprint

- Run from `/burndown-charts/current`:

  ```shell
  trollolo burndown --new-sprint --plot-to-board
  ```

  This command will automatically upload the burndown chart to Trello (you need to use a token with write rights).


## Updating the burndown chart

- Run from `/burndown-charts/current`:

  ```shell
  trollolo burndown --plot-to-board
  ```
