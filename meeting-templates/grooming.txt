This meeting aims to keep our product backlog clean:
* Process newly added cards (by declining it, sorting it or moving it 'to be groomed')
* Groom cards that are in 'to be groomed', aka. being likely to be needed in one of the next sprints



Grooming can, but doesn't have to, include:
  * Adding / Updating card definitions
  * Agree / review acceptance criterias and have it signed of by our PO
  * Add / review user stories (who? why? what?)
  * Estimate
  * Add tasks


All these tasks can also be done in planning. Even though it's recommended to have this done before to ease preparation of next sprint.
