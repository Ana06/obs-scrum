Our daily standup meeting were the dev team talks about:

- What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the Sprint?
- What will you do today to help the team finish the Sprint?
- Is there any obstacle blocking you or the team from achieving the Sprint Goal?


Our PO doesn't have to attend here, but is happily invited:-)
