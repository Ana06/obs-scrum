Our daily standup meeting were the dev team talks about:

1. What did you hate about yesterday?
2. What did you enjoy about yesterday?
3. What are you looking forward to least about today?
4. What are you looking forward to most about today?
5. What areas are you concerned about?

Formerly we did this other questions:

- What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the Sprint?
- What will you do today to help the team finish the Sprint?
- Is there any obstacle blocking you or the team from achieving the Sprint Goal?


Our PO doesn't have to attend here, but is happily invited:-)
