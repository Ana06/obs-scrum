Our daily standup meeting were the dev team talks about:

1. What did you hate about yesterday?
2. What did you enjoy about yesterday?
3. What are you looking forward to least about today?
4. What are you looking forward to most about today?
5. What areas are you concerned about?

Our PO doesn't have to attend here, but is happily invited:-)
